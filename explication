1-the web page composed on 2 part :
  * part1: have all choeses, if we decide to bay it, its simple add item to our paquet one or more. 
    We can also removed from paquet.if you like a cpecial shose clique on icone heart.Top of page you see number of your shoeses that you bay.
  
  * part2 : you can see detail of your paquet number of each shoes that you bay it,also the price   
    of choeses.If like to remove choes,you can see what you update.In buttom you can see the global price of what you bay.

2-explication de code javascript action.js :
  * declare global variable insted to select elements by 'document.getElementById' because we will 
    used in more then one function.
  * add event to icone heart to change his color by click,we add event by 'addEventListener', we 
    associate function 'heart_ch()' that change the color.
  * add to butom 'add to cart' event to add new choes and display it in the cart.Add price 
    of this shoes to total price, we can do this by calling function 'add()'.
  * add to butom 'remove from cart' event to remove one choes.We remove price of this shoes from  
    total price, we can do this by calling function 'remove()'.
    ===>if we have total quantity of shoeses 0 or less we cant remove so we add alerte() in this case
